    <h1>My Favorite Thing About School</h1>
    <p>Although I like the courses at EPS, especially history and astronomy, my favorite thing about school is the after-school sports teams. Sports have always been an important part of my life, and this year I've really enjoyed the more competitive atmosphere
        that cross country and track have provided.</p>
    <p>The top three reasons I like the sports teams the most are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sports provide an opportunity to measure personal growth</li>
        <li>Friendly competition and team atmosphere build relationships with people from other grades</li>
        <li>The opportunity to compete helps me understand how I act in high-pressure situations</li>
        <li>Being able to work with a team is an essential life skill I will use no matter where I end up</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The season is just getting started, but you can view our team's times online at <a href="https://www.athletic.net/CrossCountry/TeamRecords.aspx?SchoolID=28911" target="_blank">athletic.net</a>.</p>
