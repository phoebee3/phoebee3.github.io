    <h1>My Favorite Thing About School</h1>



    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p>Although I like the courses at EPS, especially history and astronomy, my favorite thing about school is the after-school sports teams. Sports have always been an important part of my life, and this year I've really enjoyed the more competitive atmosphere
        that cross country and track have provided.</p>
    <p>The top three reasons I like the sports teams the most are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sports provide an opportunity to measure personal growth</li>
        <li>Friendly competition and team atmosphere build relationships with people from other grades</li>
        <li>The opportunity to compete helps me understand how I act in high-pressure situations</li>
        <li>Being able to work with a team is an essential life skill I will use no matter where I end up</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Events:</h2>
    <p>Track offers a wide variety of events, from short sprints to multiple mile efforts to field events. Since I have a background in cross country, I focus on distance and mid distance events. Although my personal favorite is the 4x400 meter relay, I'm
        also doing the open 400, 800, and 1600.</p>
    <p>Here are some other available events:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>100 meter sprint</li>
        <li>200 meter sprint</li>
        <li>3200 meter run</li>
        <li>4x100 meter relay</li>
        <li>4x200 meter relay</li>
    </ul>
