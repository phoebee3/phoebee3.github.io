        <h1>Hiking Resources</h1>
        <p>If you're interested in learning more about hiking in Washington state, here are some useful resources:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.wta.org/" target="_blank">Washington Trail Association</a>
            </li>
            <p>The WTA is my go-to site for trip reports, hiking guides, and driving information. It has a large catalogue of trails, with crowdsourced trip reports for each one.</p>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/" target="_blank">AllTrails</a>
            </li>
            <p>AllTrails is similar to the WTA, with the added bonus of being able to track and share your hiking routes and times. To find out how long a certain hike will take, AllTrails is often the better bet because through this tracking feature, you
                can see how long it took a variety of people to complete any given hike. </p>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.summitpost.org/" target="_blank">SummitPost</a>
            </li>
            <p>While not as useful for the average day hike, SummitPost is a wealth of information if you're seeking to do some mountaineering. It contains details for many major peaks and scrambling routes, including winter and ice climbing lines.</p>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.mountaineers.org/" target="_blank">The Mountaineers</a>
            </li>
            <p>The Mountaineers is an organization that promotes outdoor education and conservation. They have lots of trip reports on their site, but the great thing about The Mountaineers is they have lots of class/courses for people of all experience
                levels in everything from ice climbing to trail running to sea kayaking. They also publish many trail-related books, including "Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills" - a well established climber's bible.</p>
