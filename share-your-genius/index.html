        <p>I've always loved listening to and creating music. For years, I've turned to music as a source of comfort, fun, and connection with the people around me. I'm getting to the stage of where my life where I'm starting to find opportunities to turn
            my hobbies and passions into career-related projects, and over the past two years I've worked with multiple radio stations to create content that reflects my firm belief in the connective powers of music.</p>

        <p>In the fall of 2021, I applied for an internship/mentorship program at KEXP, a listener powered radio station based in Seattle. Throughout the year, I've created sets of music for them that are aired 6-7am on some Saturdays. It's been such a rewarding
            experience for me and a great view into what working in the music industry could be like. My favorite part of this experience was curating a show based around music from MoPOP's Sound Off concert - a concert showcasing entirely music from
            local artists under 21. </p>

        <p>The same year, I started volunteering at a small, low-power FM station based in Magnuson Park in NE Seattle called SPACE101.1 FM. I'm in charge of a show called Northwest Orbit, where I choose one local band per month to spotlight and interview.
            Since the station is so much smaller than KEXP, I've been able to take more leadership over my program. Interviewing bands has been equal parts exciting and nerve-wracking, but I've learned so much and I'm so thankful to the folks at SPACE101.1
            for giving me the opportunity to work with them!</p>
